        <p>My Mother is dying, present-tense. Her time here on this planet will soon close. I have many thoughts— as a
            son, a buddhist and a man. If only to assuage my feelings of grief a bit and to avoid relying too much on
            others, I have been writing them down, since June. As a practicing (non) buddhist, I rely on one central
            teaching — the First Noble Truth, which says that desire — specifically for things to be different, is the
            cause of all suffering. Indeed, Gautama the Buddha’s own awakening began with the realization that there is
            no avoiding sickness, old age and death. All of us falter in our acceptance of this truth at one time or
            another.</p>
        <p>On Memorial Day weekend, my mother choked on <i>hot-dog</i>, and her heart stopped. I find it painfully
            ironic that the last solid food my American-Italian Mother ate was a <i>hot-dog</i>. My father could not
            resuscitate her and she slipped into a coma. I didn’t know about the incident until the next day when my
            brother called. We already knew that she was suffering from dementia or something akin to it — hence the
            swallowing issues. When she came out of the coma, she received another diagnosis — stomach cancer. I went to
            the bed, for about three days. Not a very manly thing to do. My brother would call and tell me what was
            going on, but most people I spoke with didn’t really know what to say — if anything at all. I reached out to
            a few people at the time, most of whom were sympathetic, but for the first time I noticed very few people
            know how to deal with sickness or death, or can appreciate another person’s experience of them. There was
            awkwardness around my grief, my tearfulness, weakness and vulnerability.</p>
        <p>On the third day, I rose. I’m a “man” after all. “Get out of bed,” said the “man” inside the man.</p>
        <p>There were also strange coincidences. When my Mother renamed one of the orderlies who looked after her in the
            IC, “Leonardo,” I was reading Walter Isaacson’s new biography of Leonardo Da Vinci. Does this mean anything?
            Is it because scientists have discovered there is a little bit of me left in my Mum? I suppose I could
            choose to ignore these odd things, and say that these are just mere coincidences — but they are not.</p>
        <p>Tibetan Buddhist yogis tell us that at the time before death, many doors open to knowledge and other
            worlds — these are temporary, mental places we visit before rebirth called <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo">bardos</a>. Our ability to correctly
            navigate the bardo of death is based on our familiarity with the deep recesses of the primordial mind — most
            especially, how we experience <i>pain, suffering and loss</i>. From a calm base, connections and new karma
            can
            arise, lessons can be absorbed, the voice can be heard. What or whom we see as a monster wielding an axe to
            chop off our head transforms into a lotus-bearing goddess. If a being experiences a good, conscious death,
            then everyone around them is affected by it.</p>

        <p>Death is a tremendously important teaching. In the Zen tradition I have my some of my formal practice
            training in — we refer to this as the “great conversation.” Over the past year, I have emeshed in this
            conversation.I am finishing an elaborate, half-body tattoo, and due to my Mother’s illness, I have had
            plenty of time to meditate on pain, suffering and loss. Not coincidentally, the main subject of my back
            piece is the Bodhisattva
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%E1%B9%A3itigarbha">Kstsigharba</a> , the protector of children,
            women, and guide to the deceased between lives.</p>
        <p class="img"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wckOyhRMI6uY4I8UUEu0xQ.png" width="700px"></p>
        <p>I believe that what I can endure gracefully and consciously creates the unique sense of reality I experience.
            Nothing is left out, and everything is valuable. I hope to skillfully orientate my “self” to trauma, pain,
            and death. A calibration that in no small way — prepares me to enter into the second act of my life as I
            approach fifty, a period of time that will surely involve more suffering, death, and illness. My tattooing
            experience, my grief about my Mother’s imminent passing are <i>bardo</i> as well.</p>
        <p>Time on the tattoo table really isn’t any different from time on the zafu. I’m dealing with my body and my
            brain as I pass through a tiny bardo of people chattering, needles whirring, loud music, and of course my
            skin being inserted with ink. We can and do choose pain…the real question is first, what is the <i>real</i>
            pain in our lives — and second, do we wish to experience pain in a way that creates beauty and power or do
            we let pain overwhelm us? When I sit down on my meditation cushion, I zoom in on what hurts — what feels
            like crap. I follow the breath and ask — what is <i>this</i>?</p>
        <p>When my Mother was given six months to live, I knew that the entire process was going to deepen
            everything — and it has. I need to pay as close attention to my process as I had while being tattooed, and
            while sitting zazen. I zoomed in. I asked (about her illness and death) — what is <i>this</i>? I am more
            prepared than I may have thought — and still, as you will read in a moment, I made mistakes. I did not pay
            close enough attention. I reached outside of my own experience for understanding. Many readers will decry
            this statement — of course we need others! I happen to agree with you, but that was not the lesson this
            time.</p>
        <p>My Mum has progressive super-nuclear palsy, a degenerative disorder affecting the brain, <i>and</i> stomach
            cancer. The found the latter because of the former causes problems in swallowing, speech and aspiration. She
            will most certainly leave this life in the next few months. There is nothing special about her illness,
            except that she is my Mother, and it will be her last illness.</p>
        <p>My family is made up of three older siblings and my Dad. We are all, naturally in shock, often contentious,
            and not doing so well. Inevitably everything that was dysfunctional to begin with is now even more so — that
            includes my own behavior. I have not handled certain moments well. I blew up my ex’s phone thinking she
            could help me, that she <i>should</i> talk to me— when I knew from experience with her that this was
            definitely not a good idea.</p>
        <cite><b>Lesson: Death cannot be made “pretty” or sterilized or gentle. It is reasonable to expect the absolute
            utter worst during a time of death. Even a person with training in meditation can make errors and fall prey
            to illusion, expectations and the like. Do not beat yourself up about it.</b></cite>
        <p>A parent’s demise is a powerful bardo — an opening to huge lessons. The most important amongst them is
            forgiveness. As a family, we have long been estranged from one another. I am not sure we will grow any
            closer now — but I would like to think we can create some peace. Unfortunately, that is not unfolding, and
            that too, is a lesson. We cannot change people.</p>
        <p>My mother is eighty, she is frail, hungry, cannot swallow or speak terribly well and just got over pneumonia.
            We did not think she should have radiation treatments for fear of them making her condition worse — and of
            course, she decided she wants them because she’d have to get better to die.When I told my therapist — (who
            is fortunately a fellow practitioner) about my mother, he sighed and said, “Well, sounds like you are
            entering into a period of mourning.”</p>
        <p>A Matsuo Basho poem came to mind.</p>
        <cite><b>The temple bell stops — 
            but the sound keeps coming
            out of the flowers.
            The contrail dissipates — 
            but the sound keeps coming
            out of the sky.</b></cite>
        <p>My therapist once said to me that the best place to start is from the perspective that whatever we are doing,
            we likely have a damn good reason for doing it. Think about that one.As is often the case when the shit hits
            the fan, we morph into the anxious, codependent child needful of attention. Surprise! It’s the same pitiable
            role that I played in my family dynamic. Mind you — I chose that role and have played it extremely well for
            a long time. I might regret it, but I’m not going to deny it. Just to be clear, the dynamic I am talking
            about is different what is being touted by identity politicians, specifically…”Men hold the world hostage to
            their fragility and vulnerability — making female pain the inevitable cost of their comfort”.</p>
        <cite><b>Lesson: Accept, do not blame those who do not have the inclination, time, consideration or empathy to
            deal with you. There is nothing wrong with them — and there is nothing wrong with you hurting and needing
            either.</b></cite>
        <p>My first goal, of course, is to remain in my body and avoid drinking myself into the gutter, my second goal
            is, of course, to understand. Slowing down to mourn the loss of another human being, never mind one’s own
            Mother is about as antithetical to the bloody rush of modern “reality” as possible. And that is where I’d
            like to be — vested in a true hope for my Mother that she has the right exit — and that is all I wish. My
            concern for me is that I remain present for the experience.</p>
        <p>One of the most poignant memories I have of studying Buddhism was when I was introduced to the mustard seed
            parable. The mustard seed revolves around a woman named <i>Kisa Gotami</i> whose young son died.</p>
        <p class="img"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*c5gA0HW34pFlHcLbSsO8dw.jpeg"></p>
        <p>The story goes that Kisa hauled the corpse of her son along with her, and pleaded with the Buddha to bring
            him back to life. The Buddha paused for a while before instructing Kisa to go back to her village and gather
            mustard seeds, but only from the households of those who have never been touched by the death. From those
            mustard seeds, he promised Kisa, he would create a medicine to bring her son back to life.As one might
            expect, all of her neighbors were willing to give her mustard seeds, but they all told her that all of them
            had been touched by death one time or another. “The living are few, but the dead are many, ” her wise
            friends incanted. As the moon came up, the sad mother was still without any of the mustard seeds that she
            had been instructed to collect, but she realized the teaching of impermanence as quickly as she opened
            herself up to the notion that she really wasn’t alone at all as she wept. Everyone experiences
            suffering.</p>
        <p>The perennial questions have not changed since the time of the Buddha, but the context of inquiry has. We do
            not live in small villages, nor practice the same religion. We do not honor death. We barely discuss the end
            of a loved one. Today, some even say there will be a cure for death brought to us by artificial
            intelligence. In other words, whatever concept of immateriality and impermanence that existed in the fifth
            century BCE is different than how you or I might consider it.</p>
        <p>My well-meaning friends are bewildered when I tell them my mother is dying. They skip over it in a few
            sentences. They ask the obvious question, the one I am asking myself — when will you visit her?</p>
        <p>First, I have not had any semblance of a real relationship with my mother in a very long time. That was by
            choice — a poor one at that. I saw my Mother in the summer of 2011, but not since. She was sitting in an
            upright beach-chair next to my Father momentarily, both of them gripping a tumbler filled with vodka as if
            they had the habit to do — for nearly forty years. There was very little to talk about — and quickly,
            automatically I tried to save the situation by cracking jokes, making things up, getting them to laugh. But
            it didn’t work. I was not drinking, and the invitation to enjoy “shrimp cocktail by the pool” extended by my
            older brother hadn’t materialized. He was inside on his phone, talking to a client.</p>
        <p>Later on, as they took their positions in front of the television, I got up, wished them the best and walked
            out the door to car service waiting in the driveway.</p>
        <p>I have not seen them since. In the summer of 2014, I was living in a village in Italy finishing my first
            novel. I wrote my parents a nasty email. I explained how I felt that my childhood was stupendously shitty
            and all the ways they had fucked up. Four years later, I regret that. I chose to channel regret and my own
            lack of healing at people not equipped to do anything about it, or even process the information. My actions
            were stupid and selfish. Again, I was looking for someone else to assuage what is going on with me.</p>
        <p>I decided I didn’t want any more of that awkward evening on our patio, nor the feud between my sisters, the
            awkward conversations with my older brother with whom I have very little in common — (with whom now I have
            an excellent relationship). Nor the problematic halting discussions with my Mother whose dementia was slowly
            settling in like June fog over the Golden Gate bridge — devoid of any original beauty.</p>
        <p>There is nothing romantic about seeing a parent’s light fade out. There is a lot of ugliness in all of
            this — a lot of tubes, and machines and smells and memories that I did not want to dredge up like the clams
            I dug with my uncles years ago on the beach. Foremost amongst all this is the simple fact that the primary
            dynamic of my family has and always will be one of dysfunction.</p>
        <p>Contrary to Dr. Phil and every other charlatan making millions off the woes of others — most broken families
            <i>stay</i> broken. Even when apologies are uttered and wounds given a goodly balm of therapy and
            time — things are left as they were found, in a painful void. The squeaky wheel, whatever it might be,
            alcohol, abuse, mental illness, tends to go right on squeaking for the unfortunate families that cannot
            muster cooperation amongst themselves or from support groups or therapists.</p>
        <p>Oddly enough, a sort of calm has descended.</p>
        <p>The equanimity signals an acceptance of my powerlessness in the face of everything that is unfolding.
            Assurance comes from inwardly knowing that at this stage of my life, at this stage of my own
            evolution, — pain, death, and mourning do not need to “spin me out.” That does not mean that I am ignoring
            them — quite to the contrary, I feel every needle prick, every sound.</p>
        <cite><b>“The same wind that picks up the leaf on one side of the mountain moves the clouds over the
            valley.”</b></cite>
        <p>I accept the inevitability of my Mother’s death by admitting that I am most certainly going to be in pain
            about it now, present tense and for the foreseeable future. Instead of desperately reaching out, I go in,
            instead of running, I prepare. Instead of numbing, I wake up. Instead of bracing for impact, I let go of the
            body like I once did as a surfer — entangled in a foamy wipe-out, I let go, I let go…</p>
        <p><i>I let go.</i></p>
